## Log

### R1D1 #####

First day, did 1 hour of tutorials in the codecamp site, I have done a few before and I am tracking about 50% of the first module HTML5 and CSS.
I am a bit tired so I was stuggling to concentrate towards the end of the hour. I setup and cloned GIT on my mackbook using command line in the last 10 mins. Feeling tired but optimistic.

the first section HTML5 and CSS. Starting on the Response Design with bootstrap tomorrow
