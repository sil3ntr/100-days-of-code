## Log

### R1D1 #####

First day, did 1 hour of tutorials in the codecamp site, I have done a few before and I am tracking about 50% of the first module HTML5 and CSS.
I am a bit tired so I was stuggling to concentrate towards the end of the hour. I setup and cloned GIT on my mackbook using command line in the last 10 mins. Feeling tired but optimistic.

### R1D2 #####

Second day down, much more awake this evening, back into the swing of things, polished off
the first section HTML5 and CSS. Starting on the Response Design with bootstrap tomorrow
